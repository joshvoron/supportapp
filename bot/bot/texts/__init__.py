I am 19-year-old fullstack developer from Serbia. You can see more of my 
projects on my <a href="https://github.com/joshvoron">GitHub</a>,
or send me an email at ilyavoronovwork@gmail.com. I'd love to get some feedback! 
I can also build a backend for your website (stack: Python + Django + DRF + PostgreSQL) or create a Telegram bot (stack: Python + Aiogram + asyncpg).

I built this project on my own.
